  summary: 'A Graph Neural Network Library in Jax'
  description: |
    Jraph (pronounced "giraffe") is a lightweight library for working with
    graph neural networks in jax. It provides a data structure for graphs,
    a set of utilities for working with graphs, and a 'zoo' of forkable
    graph neural network models.
